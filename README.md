# HTML-CSS-Tasks
This repository contains various HTML and CSS tasks that I worked on during my internship. These tasks helped me gain hands-on experience in web development and improved my understanding of front-end technologies. I also learned how to effectively manage and upload projects to GitHub as part of version control and collaboration.
