        <h2>History Of Calisthenics</h2>
        <p>Calisthenics, a form of bodyweight training, has been practiced for centuries and is one of the oldest and most natural methods of physical conditioning. Derived from the Greek words “kallos” (meaning beauty) and “sthenos” (meaning strength), calisthenics emphasizes graceful movements, strength, and flexibility. This form of exercise has evolved over the ages, from ancient civilizations to modern-day street workouts, demonstrating its timeless appeal and effectiveness.</p>

        <h2>How To Start</h2>
        <p>To start calisthenics, begin with basic bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, planks, and pull-ups. Focus on mastering proper form to avoid injury and gradually increase repetitions as you build strength. Start with a routine that targets all major muscle groups, performing exercises 2-3 times a week. As you progress, incorporate more challenging movements like dips, handstands, or muscle-ups. Consistency and patience are key, and you can practice calisthenics anywhere with minimal equipment, making it easy to integrate into your fitness routine.</p>
